# Can't Believe my Luck - Sports!

A Kobayashi Maru Studios Game

A series of easy and (meant to be) funny games written in Lua and prepared to 
be used in a PSP that can use homebrew. The topic of the games must be 
somehow related to the webcomic CBML, by using characters or stories from the 
comics.
